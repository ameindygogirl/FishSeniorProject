The following are problems with the current JSON

*ClerkSTm should not be for an individual survey but rather for an entire work session which may encompass 
more then one survey. 
*Also the client had told us target species is per grp not per entry. 
*For the AngChkTm is that the start time for the group because shouldn't there also be a finish time? 

Other then these issues it appears are projects will align nicely.
